# IRIS LMAOBOX  
![IRIS LMAOBOX Banner](https://i.imgur.com/aauUYTK.png)  

This is literally a giant mashup of a ton of scripts made for LMAOBOX  
I didn't write much in here, almost all my work is editing and combining scripts I use  
I only made this giant mess because I wanted to use multiple scripts but also didn't want to have to load a list every time I launch the game  
Not to mention some would not load together because of errors so I had to fix them  

Yes I know this script looks like an absolute mess  
Yes I know some things do not fit well on any resolution that is NOT 1920x1080  
Yes I know that this was probably pointless but I did it anyway  

# NOTES  
![NOTES Banner](https://i.imgur.com/BaejxlC.png)  
It is recommended to install the provided font files so that the text overlays from the script look as they should  
There are 2 versions of IRIS, Optimized and Unstable  
Unstable is the full thing with everything I use thrown in but also runs the risk of lag and crashing  
Optimized has the problems stripped out with most of the script still in tact (utils and chams are gone)  
I don't know how long I'll keep doing this because this was originally meant to be private
