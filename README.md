# IRIS LMAOBOX  
![IRIS LMAOBOX Banner](https://i.imgur.com/aauUYTK.png)  

This is literally a giant mashup of a ton of scripts made for LMAOBOX  
I didn't write much in here, almost all my work is editing and combining scripts I use  
I only made this giant mess because I wanted to use multiple scripts but also didn't want to have to load a list every time I launch the game  
Not to mention some would not load together because of errors so I had to fix them  

Yes I know this script looks like an absolute mess  
Yes I know some things do not fit well on any resolution that is NOT 1920x1080  
Yes I know that this was probably pointless but I did it anyway  

# NOTES  
![NOTES Banner](https://i.imgur.com/BaejxlC.png)  
It is recommended to install the provided font files so that the text overlays from the script look as they should  
I don't know how long I'll keep doing this because this was originally meant to be private
